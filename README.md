# Welcome to Unit Ventures!

## What we do
We invest in early-stage deeptech companies solving hard science or engineering problems. You can read more about it on our [blog](https://randhindi.substack.com).

We particularly like:
- vertically integrated hardware-software solutions
- cryptography (for blockchain or otherwise)
- biotech (with a strong focus on longevity)

Ticket size $50k-$250k. We like to reinvest in the next rounds too.
